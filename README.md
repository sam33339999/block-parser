# Project Purpose

This project aims to define a standardized JSON structure that allows Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate content accordingly. In this approach, the LLM's task is simplified to providing only the core content and its "intent" (e.g., marking a piece of text as a level-one heading, or specifying a two-column layout for a section). All specific implementation details regarding styling and layout (such as HTML/CSS coding) are then handled by the front-end templating engine, which dynamically processes and renders the JSON data output by the LLM.

The core advantages of this method include:

1.  **Minimized LLM Output**: The LLM only needs to focus on content and structural intent (e.g., this is a level-one heading, this is a layout with two columns), without needing to handle complex presentation layer logic.
2.  **Clear Block Types**: Defines a limited yet comprehensive set of block types to cover most needs, ensuring structural consistency and predictability.
3.  **Data-Driven Styling**: The concrete implementation of styles and layouts (HTML/CSS) is dynamically generated by the front-end templating engine based on the JSON data output by the LLM, achieving a separation of content and presentation.
4.  **Clear Instructions**: The prompts given to the LLM must clearly specify the expected JSON structure and available block types to ensure the accuracy of the output.

PROMPTS:

```txt
Hello! You are a content generation assistant. Your task is to generate content based on my requests and strictly output this content in the specified JSON format.

Please write an article for me about **[Please fill in your topic here]**.

**Output Format Requirements:**

Please format the entire output as a single JSON object. The root level of this JSON object should contain a `document` key, whose value is an object containing the following:
- `title` (optional): String, representing the main title of the article. If not provided, it can be determined by the first `heading` block.
- `blocks`: An array, where each element is a JSON object describing a content block.

**Block Structure:**

Each content block object must contain the following two keys:
1.  `type`: String, indicating the type of the block.
2.  `data`: A JSON object, containing data specific to that block type.

**Supported Block Types (`type`) and their `data` Structures:**

1.  **`heading`**
    *   `data`:
        *   `level`: Number, representing the heading level (1 to 6).
        *   `text`: String, the text content of the heading.
        *   `anchorId` (optional): String, used for in-page anchors. If not provided, the system may generate one automatically.

2.  **`paragraph`**
    *   `data`:
        *   `text`: String, the text content of the paragraph.
          - `\n` in the string will be converted to line breaks.
          - Supports Markdown inline formatting, such as `**bold**`, `****also bold****`, and `*italic*`.
          - Supports color tags, such as `[color:red]text[/color]`, `[bgColor:yellow]text[/bgColor]`, or `[color:red,bgColor:yellow]text[/bgColor]`.

3.  **`code`** (Code Block)
    *   `data`:
        *   `language`: String, specifying the language of the code (e.g., "javascript", "python", "html").
        *   `code`: String, the actual code content.

4.  **`mermaid`** (Mermaid Diagram)
    *   `data`:
        *   `code`: String, the syntax definition for the Mermaid diagram.

5.  **`table`**
    *   `data`:
        *   `hasHeader` (optional): Boolean (true/false), indicating if the table has a header. It is recommended that the LLM provide this field whenever possible, setting it to `true` if applicable.
        *   `headers`: An array of strings, representing the content of each cell in the header (relevant only if `hasHeader` is `true` or a header is expected).
        *   `rows`: A two-dimensional array of strings. Each inner array represents a row in the table, where each element is the string content of the corresponding cell in that row.

6.  **`layoutColumns`** (Multiple blocks side-by-side in the same row / Column Layout)
    *   `data`:
        *   `columnCount`: Number, indicating the number of columns (e.g., 2 or 3).
        *   `distribution` (optional): An array of strings, representing the width proportions of each column (e.g., `["50%", "50%"]`, `["1fr", "2fr"]`). If not provided, equal distribution can be used.
        *   `columns`: An array whose length should equal `columnCount`. Each element of this array is itself an **array of block objects**, representing the content blocks contained within that column. These nested block objects also follow the `type` and `data` structure defined in this prompt.

7.  **`anchorLink`** (Anchor/Normal Link)
    *   `data`:
        *   `text`: String, the display text for the link.
        *   `href`: String, the target address of the link.
            *   Starting with `#` (e.g., `#section1`): Will act as an in-page anchor, navigating within the current page.
            *   Starting with `http://`, `https://`, or `//` (e.g., `https://www.example.com`): Will act as an external link, opening in a new browser tab.
            *   Other relative paths (e.g., `/about.html`, `another-page.html`): Will act as an internal page link, navigating within the current page.

**Output Example:**

Below is a simple JSON output example, containing a level-one heading and a paragraph:
```json
{
  "document": {
    "title": "Example Article Title",
    "blocks": [
      {
        "type": "heading",
        "data": {
          "level": 1,
          "text": "This is the main title of the article",
          "anchorId": "main-title-example"
        }
      },
      {
        "type": "paragraph",
        "data": {
          "text": "This is a normal paragraph of text content.\nIt includes a line break.\nIt can include **bold text**, ****also bold text****, or *italic text*.\nThis is a piece of [color:red]red text[/color], and a piece of text with a [bgColor:yellow]yellow background[/bgColor].\nFinally, here is [color:blue,bgColor:lightgray]blue text with a light gray background[/color]."
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
